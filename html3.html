<h2> Rosie's Daily activity </h2>

Great Pyrenees are known for being outdoor dogs and this is exactly the case for Rosie as well. Rosie spends most of her days fulfilling her Livestock Guardian Dog duties.

She patrols the perimeter of the 30 acre farm she resides on and watches over a small herd of cattle and large flock of chickens.

Rosie requires many hours of sleep during the day because Great Pyrenees are technically nocturnal though this trait doesn't stop her from sleeping at night as well.

Generally, Great Pyrenees need to be walked 20-40 minutes per day if they don't already spend most of their days outside.

It's important to make sure this breed gets plenty of exercise so they don't get overweight because the breed is known to get Hip Dysplasia in their later stages of life.

This occurs from obesity and lack of activity.
