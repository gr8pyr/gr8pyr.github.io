<p>Welcome to the personal and informational website of Rosie, a Great Pyrenees Rescue from Hodgdon, ME, USA.</p>
<h2>About</h2>

Rosie was born May 15, 2017, in Smyrna, Maine.

She was the largest puppy in a litter of 10. Rosie and her siblings were unexpected and were put up for adoption via the Northeast Pyrenees Rescue following their births.

Rosie was adopted by her owner because he got in contact with the Northeast Pyr Rescue's New England President and was informed of the available puppies in his area.

Rosie is currently over 1 year old and weighs 120 lbs.
