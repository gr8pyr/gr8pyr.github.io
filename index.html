<p>Welcome to the personal and informational website of Rosie, a Great Pyrenees Rescue from Hodgdon, ME, USA.</p>
<h2>About</h2>

Rosie was born May 15, 2017, in Smyrna, Maine.

She was the largest puppy in a litter of 10. Rosie and her siblings were conceived unexpectedly which is why they were put up for adoption via the Northeast Pyrenees Rescue following their births.

Rosie is currently over 1 year old and now weighs 120 lbs.

<h2>Daily Schedule</h2>

Great Pyrenees are known for being outdoor dogs and this is exactly the case for Rosie as well. Rosie spends most of her days fulfilling her Livestock Guardian Dog duties.

She patrols the perimeter of the 30 acre farm she resides on and watches over a small herd of cattle and large flock of chickens.

Rosie requires many hours of sleep during the day because Great Pyrenees are technically nocturnal though this trait doesn't stop her from sleeping at night as well.

<h3>Diet</h3>

Rosie eats Taste of the Wild Sierra Mountain Canine Recipe with Roasted Lamb.
She eats 2 cups of food twice a day (morning and night.)
<h3> Exercise</h3>

Rosie requires at least 2 hours of exercise each day. Normally, she spends most of her days outside where she fulfills most of her exercise requirements.
She needs to occasionally be walked on a leash to get extra exercise.
She also enjoys playing tug-o-war.
